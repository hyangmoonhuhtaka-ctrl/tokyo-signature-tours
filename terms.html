<h1>Terms of Conditions</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date: November 26, 2025</strong></p>

<h2>Article 1 (Purpose and Application of these Terms)</h2>
<p>These Terms of Use (hereinafter, these “Terms”) set forth the conditions for the use of the guided private tour services and related concierge services (collectively, the “Services”) provided by Tokyo Signature Tours (hereinafter, the “Company”).</p>

<p>These Terms apply to all customers who use the Services (hereinafter, “Customers”).</p>

<p>A Customer shall be deemed to have agreed to these Terms at the time the Customer makes a reservation application for the Services or otherwise commences use of the Services, and these Terms shall constitute a part of the tour contract between the Company and the Customer. Customers who do not agree to these Terms may not use the Services.</p>

<p>In the event of any inconsistency between these Terms and any individual conditions presented by the Company in connection with the Services, such as booking confirmations, notices, or safety instructions, such individual conditions shall prevail.</p>

<h2>Article 2 (Description of the Services and Distinction from Travel Agency Business)</h2>
<p>The Company provides the following services (collectively, the “Tours”):</p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) Guided sightseeing services with an accompanying guide;</li>
  <li>(2) Itinerary proposals and provision of sightseeing information tailored to the Customer’s preferences;</li>
  <li>(3) Advice and assistance regarding restaurant and sightseeing facility reservations; and</li>
  <li>(4) Other concierge services intended to enhance the Customer’s sightseeing experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Company is not a travel agency and does not provide any travel contracts under the Japanese Travel Agency Act, including but not limited to arranged tour contracts or custom-organized tour contracts.</p>

<p>The Company does not perform reservations, payments, custody of funds, advances, or collection of fees on behalf of Customers for accommodations, transportation, sightseeing facilities, restaurants, or any other services. Even when the Company assists a Customer with reservations for third-party services, the contract regarding such third-party services shall be solely between the Customer and the applicable third-party service provider, and the Company shall not be a party to such contract.</p>

<p>If a guide holds a professional qualification (such as national licensed interpreter-guide, regional interpreter-guide, or no qualification), the type of qualification will be disclosed in advance. The Company shall not make any false or misleading statements regarding the existence or type of such qualifications.</p>

<h2>Article 3 (Formation of Contract)</h2>
<p>A tour contract between the Company and the Customer (the “Tour Contract”) shall be formed when the Customer makes a reservation via the method prescribed by the Company for use of the Services, and the Company sends a booking confirmation (the “Booking Confirmation”) to the Customer via email or other method designated by the Company.</p>

<p>Even after a Tour Contract has been formed, if payment of the tour fee is not confirmed by the payment deadline specified by the Company, the relevant reservation shall be automatically cancelled.</p>

<p>The Company may refuse a reservation application if any of the following circumstances apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) The Customer has provided false information;</li>
  <li>(2) The Company reasonably determines that it would be difficult to ensure the safety of the guide or to properly perform the Services; or</li>
  <li>(3) The Customer has previously engaged in conduct that violated these Terms or constituted nuisance behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Article 4 (Conditions of Use, Age, and Health)</h2>
<p>As a general rule, only persons who are at least eighteen (18) years of age may make a reservation for the Services. If a person under eighteen (18) years of age participates in a Tour, a parent or guardian who is at least twenty (20) years of age must accompany such minor, and such parent or guardian shall bear all responsibility for the safety and conduct of the minor.</p>

<p>The tours typically involve walking approximately 3–10 kilometers, climbing and descending stairs, waiting in crowded areas, and dealing with variations in temperature and weather.</p>

<p>If the Customer has any medical conditions, prior illnesses, pregnancy, or other concerns regarding health or physical fitness, the Customer shall, at the Customer’s own responsibility, consult with a physician in advance and make the final decision regarding participation.</p>

<p>The Company and its guides are not medical professionals and do not guarantee the Customer’s health, physical condition, or safety.</p>
