    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: December 15, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Article 1 (Purpose and Application of These Terms)</h2>
    <p>These Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”) set forth the conditions governing the use of the guided sightseeing services with an accompanying guide and related concierge services (collectively, the “Services”) provided by Tokyo Signature Tours (the “Company”).</p>
    <p>These Terms apply to all customers who use the Services (“Customers”).</p>
    <p>A Customer is deemed to have agreed to these Terms when the Customer submits a reservation application for the Services or otherwise begins using the Services. These Terms constitute a part of the tour contract between the Company and the Customer. Customers who do not agree to these Terms may not use the Services.</p>
    <p>If these Terms conflict with any booking confirmation, notices, safety instructions, or other individual conditions presented by the Company in connection with the Services, such individual conditions shall prevail.</p>

    <h2>Article 2 (Description of the Services and Distinction from Travel Agency Business)</h2>
    <p>The Company provides the following services (collectively, the “Tours”):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) Guided sightseeing services with an accompanying guide;</li>
      <li>(2) Itinerary proposals and provision of sightseeing information tailored to Customer preferences;</li>
      <li>(3) Advice and assistance regarding restaurants, sightseeing facilities, and similar reservations; and</li>
      <li>(4) Other concierge services intended to enhance the Customer’s sightseeing experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Company is not a travel agency and does not provide any travel contracts under the Japanese Travel Agency Act, including arranged tour contracts or custom-organized tour contracts.</p>
    <p>The Company does not conduct reservations or payments for, custody or advance of funds for, or collection of fees on behalf of Customers in connection with accommodations, transportation, sightseeing facilities, restaurants, or any other services. Even where the Company assists with a reservation for third-party services, the relevant contract is solely between the Customer and the applicable third-party service provider, and the Company shall not be a party to such contract.</p>
    <p>If a guide holds a professional qualification (e.g., national licensed interpreter-guide, regional interpreter-guide, or no qualification), the type of qualification will be disclosed in advance. The Company will not make any false or misleading statements regarding the existence or type of such qualifications.</p>

    <h2>Article 3 (Formation of Contract)</h2>
    <p>A tour contract is formed when the Customer makes a reservation using the method designated by the Company and the Company sends the Customer a booking confirmation by email or other method designated by the Company.</p>
    <p>Even after a tour contract is formed, if payment is not confirmed by the payment deadline specified by the Company, the reservation shall be automatically canceled.</p>
    <p>The Company may refuse a reservation application if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) The Customer is found to have provided false information;</li>
      <li>(2) The Company reasonably determines that it would be difficult to ensure the guide’s safety or to properly perform the Services; or</li>
      <li>(3) The Customer has previously violated these Terms or engaged in nuisance behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 4 (Conditions of Use, Age, and Health)</h2>
    <p>As a general rule, only persons eighteen (18) years of age or older may make a reservation for the Services. If a person under eighteen (18) participates in a Tour, a parent or guardian at least twenty (20) years of age must accompany such minor, and such parent or guardian shall bear all responsibility for the minor’s safety management and all other responsibilities.</p>
    <p>Tours typically include approximately 3–10 kilometers of walking, climbing and descending stairs, waiting in crowded areas, and coping with temperature differences and weather conditions.</p>
    <p>If the Customer has any chronic condition, medical history, pregnancy, or other concerns regarding health or physical fitness, the Customer shall, at the Customer’s own responsibility, consult a physician in advance and make the final decision regarding participation.</p>
    <p>The Company and its guides are not medical professionals and do not guarantee the Customer’s physical condition, health status, or safety.</p>

    <h2>Article 5 (Participation Requirements: Environment, Allergies, Alcohol, Strollers, etc.)</h2>
    <p><strong>Weather Conditions</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) In the event of light rain, Tours will generally be conducted.</li>
      <li>(2) If the Company determines that there are safety concerns due to severe weather warnings, disasters, or other circumstances, the Company may modify or cancel the Tour pursuant to Article 14.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Customers who have a significantly low tolerance for crowds or congested environments must notify the Company in advance.</p>

    <p><strong>Allergies and Dietary Restrictions</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) If the Customer has any allergies, dietary restrictions, or other circumstances requiring special consideration, the Customer must notify the Company in advance. If the Customer fails to do so, the Company does not guarantee accommodation of such needs.</li>
      <li>(2) The Company does not guarantee, and assumes no responsibility for, the safety of any food, beverages, or other items provided by third-party service providers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Alcohol Consumption</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) Under Japanese law, alcohol consumption is permitted only for persons aged twenty (20) or older.</li>
      <li>(2) If excessive drinking, nuisance behavior, or dangerous conduct is observed, the Company or the guide may immediately terminate the Tour, and no refund will be provided.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Strollers and Wheelchairs</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) Due to terrain, stairs, steps, and crowd conditions, some Tour routes may not be suitable for strollers or wheelchairs.</li>
      <li>(2) If the Customer fails to notify the Company in advance regarding stroller or wheelchair use and, as a result, the itinerary is changed or shortened on the Tour date, no refund will be provided.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 6 (Payment Method)</h2>
    <p>As a general rule, Tour fees shall be paid in advance by credit card (via Stripe or other payment method designated by the Company).</p>
    <p>The Company does not hold, advance, or collect funds on behalf of Customers. Exchange rates, credit card company fees, and any related charges shall be borne by the Customer. Even where a refund is issued, the refund will be based on the actual amount received by the Company, and foreign exchange losses and payment processing fees may be excluded from the refund.</p>
    <p>A reservation is deemed confirmed upon completion of payment.</p>
    <p>In the event of erroneous or duplicate charges during the payment process, the Company will correct such charges or issue a refund within a reasonable scope.</p>

    <h2>Article 7 (Items Included and Not Included in the Tour Fee)</h2>
    <p>The Tour fee includes, in principle:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) Guided sightseeing services and language support provided by the guide; and</li>
      <li>(2) Pre-tour consultation and itinerary advice.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Tour fee does not include, in principle:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) Food and beverages;</li>
      <li>(2) Public transportation, taxis, ride-share, and any other transportation expenses;</li>
      <li>(3) Tickets for sightseeing facilities, activity fees, and other admission or participation fees;</li>
      <li>(4) Lodging expenses, travel insurance, airline tickets, and other travel-related costs; and</li>
      <li>(5) Gratuities (tips), which are voluntary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 8 (Age Classification and Treatment of Tour Fees)</h2>
    <p>Unless the Company separately specifies otherwise, participant count and Tour fee treatment shall be determined based on age as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) Ages 0–1: Free of charge and not counted as participants.</li>
      <li>(2) Ages 2–5: Whether and how such participants are counted, and whether any fee applies (e.g., 50% of the adult fee or free), shall be determined on a case-by-case basis at the Company’s discretion, taking into account itinerary content, mobility burden, and the terms of third-party service providers, and shall be set only after disclosure by the Company and Customer consent.</li>
      <li>(3) Ages 6 and above: Treated as adults and counted as participants.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Age shall be determined based on the participant’s full age on the Tour date.</p>
    <p>Customers must accurately declare participant ages at the time of booking (including dates of birth where children are included). No refunds will be provided even if itinerary changes, reductions, or additional charges arise due to incorrect or incomplete declarations.</p>

    <h2>Article 9 (Day-of Operations, Meeting Point, Tardiness, and No-Show)</h2>
    <p>The meeting place and meeting time shall be as set forth in the booking confirmation. Unless otherwise specified, times shall be based on Japan Standard Time (JST).</p>
    <p>Even if the Tour start time is delayed due to the Customer’s late arrival, the Tour end time will not be extended. No reduction of the Tour fee, refund, or free extension will be provided.</p>
    <p>If the Customer fails to arrive within thirty (30) minutes after the scheduled meeting time, regardless of whether the Customer has contacted the Company or the guide, the Company may treat the situation as a no-show and cancel the Tour. In such case, no refund will be provided.</p>

    <h2>Article 10 (Changes, Cancellations, and Refunds)</h2>
    <p>Customer-initiated cancellations are subject to the following refund rules (based on the scheduled Tour start time):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) Cancellation at least seventy-two (72) hours before start: 100% refund of the Tour fee;</li>
      <li>(2) Cancellation more than twenty-four (24) hours but less than seventy-two (72) hours before start: 50% refund of the Tour fee;</li>
      <li>(3) Cancellation within twenty-four (24) hours before start, late arrival, or no-show: no refund.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even where a refund is made, the Company may, at its discretion, deduct payment processing fees, foreign exchange losses, or other related costs.</p>
    <p>When a refund is due, the Company will process the refund within fourteen (14) business days from the date the Company determines that a refund is to be made. After processing, it may take approximately three (3) to thirty (30) days for the refund to appear, depending on the card issuer.</p>

    <h2>Article 11 (Changes to Reservation Details and Change Fees)</h2>
    <p>If a Customer wishes to change reservation details (including Tour date/time, number of participants, or meeting point), the Customer must promptly contact the Company using the method designated by the Company. The number of participants includes children counted pursuant to Article 8.</p>
    <p>Whether changes can be accepted will be determined at the Company’s discretion in light of guide availability, day-of operations, the terms of third-party service providers, and other circumstances. The Company may refuse requested changes.</p>
    <p>If a Customer-initiated change effectively constitutes a change of date, time, number of participants, or otherwise materially alters the nature of the Tour, the Company may apply the cancellation policy in Article 10 and charge the Customer for any price differences, cancellation fees, or other costs arising from such change.</p>
    <p>The Company may separately establish, on its website or in the booking confirmation, whether change fees apply and the amount and conditions thereof, and such terms shall form a part of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Article 12 (Extensions on the Day of the Tour and Additional Fees)</h2>
    <p>If the Customer requests an extension on the Tour date, whether to accept such request shall be determined at the discretion of the Company or the guide, considering guide schedules, last-train times, legal constraints, safety, and other circumstances. Neither the Company nor any guide is obligated to accept an extension.</p>
    <p>If an extension is accepted, the Customer shall pay an additional extension fee calculated based on the rates established by the Company. The applicable rates will be disclosed in the booking confirmation or on the Company’s website.</p>
    <p>As a general rule, an agreement to extend is formed when the guide presents the extension conditions (time and fee) verbally or via chat during the Tour and the Customer agrees.</p>
    <p>The extension fee shall be paid by credit card or other method designated by the Company, and the Company may invoice separately or process an additional payment for the extension portion.</p>

    <h2>Article 13 (Additional Fees for Special Conditions)</h2>
    <p>Additional fees may apply separate from the standard Tour fee in cases including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) Special itineraries;</li>
      <li>(2) Peak-season arrangements;</li>
      <li>(3) Group or large-party arrangements;</li>
      <li>(4) Long-distance travel; or</li>
      <li>(5) Special arrangements or requests, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If additional fees apply, the Company will provide a prior estimate and explanation, and will proceed only after obtaining the Customer’s consent.</p>

    <h2>Article 14 (Changes and Cancellations Due to Force Majeure or Safety Reasons)</h2>
    <p>If, due to circumstances beyond the Company’s reasonable control (including earthquakes, typhoons, pandemics, transportation disruptions, public events, or facility closures), the Company determines it is difficult to operate the Tour, the Company may cancel the Tour and refund 100% of the Tour fee received. For clarity, the refund is limited to the Tour fee only, and the Company will not compensate for airfare, lodging, or any other incidental expenses.</p>
    <p>If, after commencement, the Tour is interrupted due to the foregoing or similar circumstances, the Company shall determine, at its reasonable discretion and considering performance remaining and costs incurred, whether any refund will be issued and the amount thereof.</p>

    <h2>Article 15 (Guide Substitution and Alternative Service)</h2>
    <p>If a guide is unable to perform due to illness, accident, family emergency, transportation disruptions, or other unavoidable reasons, the Company may substitute another guide whom the Company reasonably considers to have comparable skills and experience, without prior notice. So long as the Tour is provided lawfully and appropriately, such substitution shall not constitute non-performance by the Company.</p>
    <p>Except where the Tour content is materially changed due to substitution, the Company will not accept cancellations, refunds, or discounts solely because a different guide was provided.</p>
    <p>If no substitute guide can be arranged despite reasonable efforts, the Company may cancel the Tour and refund the Tour fee in full. The Company will not be liable for airfare, lodging, or other incidental expenses.</p>
    <p>If the Customer refuses, without reasonable grounds, to participate with the substitute guide, such refusal will be treated as a Customer-initiated cancellation, and Article 10 will apply.</p>

    <h2>Article 16 (Subcontracting)</h2>
    <p>The Company may subcontract all or part of the Services to external guides or other businesses selected by the Company (each, a “Subcontractor”).</p>
    <p>In selecting Subcontractors, the Company will consider expertise, safety, reliability, and legal compliance, and will apply reasonable selection criteria.</p>
    <p>The Company remains responsible to Customers under these Terms and the Tour Contract even if the Company subcontracts, and subcontracting shall not reduce or limit the Company’s obligations.</p>
    <p>Customers may not request, specify, or demand particular individual guides or Subcontractors. The Company may change Subcontractors as necessary for operational reasons.</p>

    <h2>Article 17 (Position of Third-Party Services)</h2>
    <p>Even if the Company introduces restaurants, eateries, sightseeing facilities, activities, transportation providers, taxi companies, ticket vendors, or other third-party services (“Third-Party Service Providers”) and assists with reservations or accompanies the Customer, any contract regarding such third-party services is solely between the Customer and the applicable Third-Party Service Provider. The Company is not a party, agent, intermediary, or reseller with respect to such contracts.</p>
    <p>The Company makes no warranties and assumes no responsibility regarding:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) The quality, safety, hygiene, environment, or other aspects of services or products provided by Third-Party Service Providers;</li>
      <li>(2) Changes in business hours or service content, delays, interruptions, or cancellations;</li>
      <li>(3) Allergic reactions, food poisoning, illness, or other health impacts; or</li>
      <li>(4) Theft, loss, accidents, or other incidents.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any disputes, claims, or damages arising from third-party services shall be resolved between the Customer and the relevant Third-Party Service Provider. Except in cases of the Company’s willful misconduct or gross negligence, the Company bears no responsibility.</p>

    <h2>Article 18 (Photos, Videos, and Intellectual Property)</h2>
    <p><strong>Intellectual Property of the Company</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) All intellectual property rights in the Company’s website, itineraries, images, videos, logos, written materials, documents, the brand name “Tokyo Signature Tours,” and other content provided by the Company belong to the Company or its licensors.</li>
      <li>(2) Customers may not, beyond the scope of personal use, reproduce, reuse, publish, sell, modify, redistribute, or otherwise exploit Company content.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Photography and Use by the Company</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) The Company or its guides may photograph or record videos during the Tour.</li>
      <li>(2) If the Company intends to use such photos or videos for marketing purposes (including posting on social media or the Company website), the Company will explain this in advance and will use such media only after obtaining the Customer’s explicit written consent.</li>
      <li>(3) The Company will not refuse participation solely because the Customer does not consent.</li>
      <li>(4) If the Customer withdraws consent, the Company will respond within a reasonable scope; however, removal may be technically or practically difficult for printed materials or third-party reposts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Photography and Posts by Customers</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) Customers must respect portrait and privacy rights of other participants, bystanders, and facility staff, and comply with each facility’s photography rules.</li>
      <li>(2) Customers must not post content that unfairly harms a guide’s portrait rights, privacy, reputation, or credibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Use of Reviews</strong></p>
    <p>The Company may use and publish reviews, comments, feedback, or testimonials voluntarily provided by Customers after anonymization or other appropriate processing.</p>

    <h2>Article 19 (Prohibited Conduct)</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>(4) Any conduct related to illegal drugs or dangerous substances;</li>
      <li>(5) Obscene acts, solicitation, religious activities, or political activities;</li>
      <li>(6) Commercial misappropriation or copying of Tour content, itineraries, or materials;</li>
      <li>(7) False reviews, defamation, spreading harmful rumors, or other conduct harming the reputation or credibility of the Company or guides;</li>
      <li>(8) Fraudulent reservations, prank bookings, reservations under false names, or other improper booking methods; or</li>
      <li>(9) Any other conduct the Company reasonably deems inappropriate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If a Customer violates the preceding paragraph, the Company may terminate the Tour immediately, refuse future reservations, seek damages, and take other reasonable measures. In such cases, no refund will be provided.</p>

    <h2>Article 20 (Prohibition on Assignment or Resale of Reservations)</h2>
    <p>Customers may not, without the Company’s prior consent in writing or electronic form, assign, transfer, or resell (in whole or in part) their position under the tour contract, any reservation, or any right or obligation thereunder to any third party.</p>

    <p>The foregoing shall not apply where the Company has expressly approved, in writing, bookings through travel agencies, third-party platforms, or other businesses.</p>

    <h2>Article 21 (Exclusion of Anti-Social Forces)</h2>
    <p>The Customer represents and warrants that the Customer is not currently, and will not in the future become, an organized crime group, member thereof, related company, corporate racketeer, anti-social force, or similar person (collectively, “Anti-Social Forces”), and that the Customer does not maintain close relationships with Anti-Social Forces.</p>
    <p>If the Customer is found to be in violation of the preceding paragraph, the Company may terminate the tour contract and immediately cease providing the Services without notice, and no refund will be issued.</p>

    <h2>Article 22 (Limitation of Liability)</h2>
    <p>The Company’s liability to the Customer is limited to direct and ordinary damages actually incurred by the Customer due to the Company’s negligence.</p>
    <p>The maximum amount of damages payable by the Company shall be limited to the Tour fee (excluding tax) actually received by the Company for the applicable Tour; provided, however, this limitation shall not apply to damages arising from the Company’s willful misconduct or gross negligence, or damages involving injury to life or body.</p>
    <p>Except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence, the Company shall not be liable for:</p>
    <ul>

    <p>Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Services shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tokyo District Court or Tokyo Summary Court as the court of first instance, depending on the amount in controversy.</p>
    <p>The Japanese version of these Terms is the official and controlling version. In the event of any inconsistency in interpretation between the Japanese version and any translation, the Japanese version shall prevail.</p>

    <h2>Article 27 (Amendment of These Terms)</h2>
    <p>The Company may amend these Terms if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) The amendment is in the general interest of Customers; or</li>
      <li>(2) The amendment is reasonable considering the Services, the necessity of amendment, the reasonableness of the amended content, and other relevant circumstances.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When amending these Terms, the Company will announce the amended Terms and their effective date on the Company’s website or by other means the Company deems appropriate, a reasonable period before the effective date.</p>
    <p>For reservations made after the effective date of the amended Terms, the amended Terms shall apply.</p>
    <p>As a general rule, the version in effect at the time the tour contract was formed shall apply to that contract. However, the Company may apply the amended Terms to existing contracts where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) The amendment responds to legal changes and does not disadvantage Customers; or</li>
      <li>(2) The amendment is clearly beneficial to Customers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 28 (Means of Communication)</h2>
    <p>The Company will contact Customers regarding the Services via the email address provided at booking, a Company-designated chat application (e.g., WhatsApp), or notices on the Company’s website.</p>
    <p>Any notice from the Company shall be deemed delivered when it would normally be received once sent by the methods above. The Company is not liable if the Customer fails to receive notices due to incorrect registration, failure to update contact information, or other reasons attributable to the Customer.</p>
    <p>Communications from Customers to the Company are valid only if made through official contact methods stated on the Company’s website (email address, inquiry form, or other designated means). The Company does not guarantee response to social media direct messages or other unofficial channels.</p>
    <p>The Company’s standard business hours and response-time guidelines will be separately stated on the Company’s website or in the booking confirmation. The Company will endeavor to respond in good faith; however, the Company does not guarantee response within such timeframes due to emergencies, peak seasons, holidays, or other circumstances.</p>

    <h2>Article 29 (Good-Faith Negotiation)</h2>
    <p>If any matter is not provided for in these Terms, or if any question arises regarding interpretation, the Company and the Customer shall confer and endeavor to resolve the matter in good faith.</p>

    <h2>Article 30 (Severability)</h2>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms, or any portion thereof, is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or other competent authority, the remaining provisions and portions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
    <p>In such event, the Company and the Customer shall, in good faith, endeavor to replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision that most closely reflects the intent and purpose of the original provision.</p>
